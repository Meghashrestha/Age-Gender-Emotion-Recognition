# Age, Gender, and Emotion Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a system for classifying gender, age group, and emotion using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms. The system achieves high accuracy rates on various datasets, including the IMDB gender dataset, Kaggle emotion dataset, and IMDB age dataset.

## Project Overview

The project aims to accurately classify gender, age group, and emotion from images using machine learning techniques. It leverages Python programming language along with OpenCV for image processing and CNN models for classification tasks.

## Implementation Details

### Language and Tools

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementation.
- **OpenCV**: Utilized for image processing tasks such as face detection and feature extraction.
- **CNN**: Convolutional Neural Network algorithms employed for gender, age group, and emotion classification.

### Achievements

- Implemented an emotion, gender, and age-group classification system.
- Achieved high accuracy rates:
  - 96% accuracy on the IMDB gender dataset.
  - 66% accuracy on the Kaggle emotion dataset.
  - 90% accuracy on the IMDB age dataset.

## Usage

To use the system:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main script to perform gender, age group, and emotion classification on images.

## Dataset Information

- **IMDB Gender Dataset**: A dataset containing images labeled with gender information.
- **Kaggle Emotion Dataset**: A dataset consisting of images labeled with various emotion categories.
- **IMDB Age Dataset**: A dataset containing images labeled with age group information.
